## Problem Statement 

The future of Twitter is in doubt. Many people are worried that the potential failure of Twitter will leave people without a public forum. Many new private social media popped up to try to fill the void for established groups. However, that still leaves the need for people to discover new groups, and for new groups to discover potential new members. This project, Sylvester (of Sylvester and Tweety), is designed to serve that need. 

The users login to a bazaar of posts. They can like the posts that they enjoy and they can follow based on the posts they have seen. They can also make posts, which consist of at least a short message or an image, and no more than one of each together. As a stretch goal, they can separate the streams by the users that they are following or liked before. 

## Audience 
Young people (18-35) who are knowledgeable of the web and of Twitter/Facebook or similar social media sites.
